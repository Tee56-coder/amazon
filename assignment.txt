fr can be defined as fraction it is a unit of measurement

The CSS width property can be set to any specific size or percentage value, telling the browser that this should always be the minimum width of an element. Meanwhile, max-width can also use any specific size or percentage value but allows the element to expand if needed


If an element has flex: 1 , this means the size of all of the other elements will have the same width as their content, but the element with flex: 1 will have the remaining full space given to it
